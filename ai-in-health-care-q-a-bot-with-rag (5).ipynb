Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on human interpretation, which can be time-consuming and subject to human error. AI-powered medical imaging solutions use deep learning algorithms trained on vast datasets of X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to identify abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections with high accuracy.  One significant application of AI in medical imaging is the early detection of cancers, such as lung and breast cancer. AI models have been trained to detect subtle patterns in mammograms and CT scans that might be missed by radiologists. In one study, AI outperformed human radiologists in detecting breast cancer, reducing false positives and minimizing unnecessary biopsies.  AI also plays a critical role in neuroimaging, assisting in the diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Deep learning models analyze MRI scans to detect early signs of cognitive decline, enabling early interventions and better patient outcomes.  Another breakthrough in AI-driven medical imaging is its use in ophthalmology. AI-powered retinal imaging systems can detect diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness, by analyzing retinal scans for signs of damage. This allows for early treatment and reduces the risk of vision loss.  Overall, AI in medical imaging enhances diagnostic accuracy, speeds up workflow, and provides valuable insights for doctors. With continuous advancements in deep learning and computer vision, AI-driven imaging tools are expected to become an integral part of clinical practice.\"\n\nDOCUMENT2 = \"AI in Predictive Analytics and Personalized Medicine  Predictive analytics in healthcare uses AI to analyze vast amounts of patient data and identify patterns that indicate potential health risks. AI-driven predictive models process electronic health records (EHRs), genetic information, and lifestyle data to forecast the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s. This allows for early interventions, personalized treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes.  One major area where AI is making a difference is in cardiology. AI models trained on electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms can detect early signs of heart disease, including arrhythmias and heart failure, before symptoms appear. By analyzing a patient’s medical history and risk factors, AI can predict the probability of a heart attack, allowing doctors to take preventive measures.  In oncology, AI is revolutionizing cancer treatment by enabling personalized medicine. AI algorithms analyze a patient’s genetic profile to determine the most effective cancer treatment, reducing trial-and-error approaches and improving survival rates. For example, AI-driven precision oncology tools match cancer patients with targeted therapies based on their unique genetic mutations.  AI also plays a role in predicting disease outbreaks and pandemics. By analyzing global health data, AI models can identify patterns in the spread of infectious diseases, enabling governments and healthcare organizations to implement timely interventions. For instance, AI was used to track and predict the spread of COVID-19 by analyzing data from online reports, travel patterns, and hospital records.  Overall, AI-driven predictive analytics enhances early disease detection, enables precision medicine, and optimizes healthcare delivery. With continuous improvements in AI models, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to better patient care and outcomes.\"\n\nDOCUMENT3 = \"AI in Drug Discovery and Clinical Trials  The process of discovering new drugs is traditionally slow, costly, and requires years of research and testing. AI is transforming drug discovery by analyzing massive datasets, predicting potential drug candidates, and optimizing clinical trials, significantly accelerating the process.  AI-driven drug discovery involves machine learning models that analyze chemical structures and predict how they interact with biological systems. By screening millions of compounds in silico, AI helps researchers identify promising drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. For example, AI was instrumental in identifying potential treatments for COVID-19 by analyzing existing drugs that could be repurposed.  AI is also revolutionizing clinical trials by optimizing patient recruitment and improving trial efficiency. One of the major challenges in clinical trials is finding suitable participants who meet specific criteria. AI-driven tools analyze electronic health records and genetic data to identify the best candidates, ensuring trials are conducted with the most relevant patient groups. This reduces the time and cost associated with traditional recruitment methods.  Additionally, AI enhances the monitoring of clinical trials by analyzing real-time patient data. Wearable devices and sensors collect continuous health data, which AI processes to identify potential adverse effects or treatment responses. This enables researchers to make data-driven adjustments to trials, ensuring patient safety and improving outcomes.  Beyond drug discovery and trials, AI is used in precision medicine to develop personalized treatment plans. By analyzing a patient’s genetic makeup, lifestyle, and medical history, AI can recommend the most effective drugs with minimal side effects. This approach has been particularly beneficial in cancer treatment, where targeted therapies are designed based on a patient’s unique tumor profile.  In summary, AI accelerates drug discovery, optimizes clinical trials, and enables precision medicine.

Strike a conversational tone — imagine you're explaining it to someone without a healthcare background.\n\nIf there are specific topics, medical terms, or research findings mentioned, briefly explain what they mean and why they matter. Whenever possible, include links to reliable external sources or articles for further reading, so users can learn more on their own.\n\nIf the document covers multiple topics, organize your summary into clear sections or bullet points for readability.\n\nAvoid guessing or fabricating details — if anything is unclear, just mention that it wasn't explained in detail.\n\nSummarize the following document content:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    for chunk in chunks:\n        prompt += f\"{chunk}\\n\"\n\n    # Generate summary using Gemini\n    summary = client.models.generate_content(\n        model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",  # You can use pro model here for better results\n        contents=prompt\n    )\n\n    return f\"## 📄 Summary of the PDF:\\n\\n{summary.text}\"\n\n# 🎨 Gradio Interface with Tabs\nwith gr.Blocks() as interface:\n    gr.Markdown(\"## 🤖 AI in Healthcare Chatbot\")\n\n    with gr.Tab(\"💬 Ask a Healthcare Question\"):\n        user_input = gr.Textbox(label=\"Ask me about AI in Healthcare\")\n        output = gr.Markdown()  # Using Markdown for formatted responses\n        ask_button = gr.Button(\"Submit\")\n        ask_button.click(ai_healthcare_bot, inputs=user_input, outputs=output)\n\n    with gr.Tab(\"📄 Upload PDF & Summarize it using AI\"):\n        file_input = gr.File(label=\"Upload your PDF here\", file_types=[\".pdf\"])\n        summary_output = gr.Markdown()  # Using Markdown for formatted summaries\n        summarize_button = gr.Button(\"Summarize PDF\")\n        summarize_button.click(summarize_pdf, inputs=file_input, outputs=summary_output)\n\n# 🚀 Launch App\ninterface.launch(share=True)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-04T04:17:53.497058Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-04T04:17:53.497343Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-04T04:17:55.981810Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-04T04:17:53.497319Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-04T04:17:55.980884Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7868\n* Running on public URL: https://a83650f9029243e937.gradio.live\n\nThis share link expires in 72 hours.
